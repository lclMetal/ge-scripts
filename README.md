# ge-scripts

This is a collection of useful scripts that you can use in Game Editor to make things easier for yourself.

## Scripts

- [**inspect_fps.c**](https://github.com/lclMetal/ge-scripts/blob/master/inspect_fps.c) - allows you to print average fps and fps range over time
    - Functions:
        - fpsPrint()
            ```c 
            // Usage:
            fpsPrint(FPS_AVERAGE); // or FPS_RANGE or FPS_BOTH
            ```
## Usage

### Adding a script to Game Editor
- Open Global Code by clicking [Script] -> 'Global code'
- In the Global Code window, click [File] -> 'Load'
- Search and select the .c file and then click [Load]
- Name the script by entering a name into the 'Name' field
    - For example, you can name the script after the file, like this: `script.c`
- Click [Add]

You can then view and edit the script in the Global Code by clicking [Choose].
